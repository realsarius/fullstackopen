note over Browser:
Content-Type tells the server that the data is in JSON format.

The event handler calls preventDefault() right away
to prevent the default handling of form submit.

The event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list
and re-renders the note list on the page
and sends the new note to the server.
end note
